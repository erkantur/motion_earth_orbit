    function animate_attitude(attitude_data)
        % Animate the spacecraft's attitude over time
        % This could include quaternions or Euler angles, and might involve drawing a 3D model of the spacecraft

    function plot_payload_operations(payload_data)
        % Visualize the payload operations, such as scientific observations
        % This could include plots of the data being collected, the pointing direction of instruments, etc.
